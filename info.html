								<h2>DAYCARE AND BOARDING INFORMATION</h2>
                                <p>The purpose of The Doggy Depot is to provide a safe, fun and stimulating social environment for dogs. Experienced staff will be interacting and encouraging safe, appropriate interaction and play. Crates are available to provide a quiet rest time for all pets needing a break. Most dogs do well in this environment learning safe play, basic obedience and good doggy manners using positive motivation. The Doggy Depot staff will give owners a report of their pets at the end of their fun day. To ensure the safety and health of your pet and our other guests, we require all guests to comply with the following rules and regulations.</p>
